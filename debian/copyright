modules/preprocs/nasm/nasm-eval.c modules/preprocs/nasm/nasmlib.c and
modules/preprocs/nasm/nasm-pp.c are under the following license:

 * NASM LICENCE AGREEMENT
 * ======================
 *
 * By "the Software" this licence refers to the complete contents of
 * the NASM archive, excluding this licence document itself, and
 * excluding the contents of the `test' directory. The Netwide
 * Disassembler, NDISASM, is specifically included under this licence.
 *
 * I. The Software is freely redistributable; anyone may copy the
 * Software, or parts of the Software, and give away as many copies as
 * they like to anyone, as long as this licence document is kept with
 * the Software. Charging a fee for the Software is prohibited,
 * although a fee may be charged for the act of transferring a copy,
 * and you can offer warranty protection and charge a fee for that.
 *
 * II. The Software, or parts thereof, may be incorporated into other
 * freely redistributable software (by which we mean software that may
 * be obtained free of charge) without requiring permission from the
 * authors, as long as due credit is given to the authors of the
 * Software in the resulting work, as long as the authors are informed
 * of this action if possible, and as long as those parts of the
 * Software that are used remain under this licence.
 *
 * III. Modified forms of the Software may be created and distributed
 * as long as the authors are informed of this action if possible, as
 * long as the resulting work remains under this licence, as long as
 * the modified form of the Software is distributed with documentation
 * which still gives credit to the original authors of the Software,
 * and as long as the modified form of the Software is distributed with
 * a clear statement that it is not the original form of the Software
 * in the form that it was distributed by the authors.
 *
 * IV. The Software, or parts thereof, may be incorporated into other
 * software which is not freely redistributable (i.e. software for
 * which a fee is charged), as long as permission is granted from the
 * authors of the Software. The authors reserve the right to grant this
 * permission only for a fee, which may at our option take the form of
 * royalty payments. The authors also reserve the right to refuse to
 * grant permission if they deem it necessary. For further information
 * about who exactly the authors are, see clause XI below.
 *
 * V. The Software may be incorporated, in its original archive form,
 * into software collections or archives which are not freely
 * redistributable, as long as it is clearly stated that the Software
 * itself remains freely redistributable and remains under this licence
 * and no other. Such collections are deemed not to fall under article
 * IV of this licence.
 *
 * VI. Object files or programs generated by the Software as output do
 * not fall under this licence at all, and may be placed under any
 * licence the author wishes. The authors explicitly lay no claim to,
 * and assert no rights over, any programs written by other people and
 * assembled into object form by the Software.
 *
 * VII. You may not copy, modify or distribute the Software except
 * under the terms given in this licence document. You may not
 * sublicense the Software or in any way place it under any other
 * licence than this one. Since you have not signed this licence, you
 * are not of course required to accept it; however, no other licence
 * applies to the Software, and nothing else grants you any permission
 * to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Software in any way.
 * These actions are therefore prohibited if you do not accept this
 * licence.
 *
 * VIII. There is no warranty for the Software, to the extent permitted
 * by applicable law. The authors provide the Software "as is" without
 * warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not
 * limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
 * a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and
 * performance of the Software is with you. Should the Software prove
 * defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or
 * correction.
 *
 * IX. In no event, unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
 * writing, will any of the authors be liable to you for damages,
 * including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages,
 * arising out of the use or the inability to use the Software,
 * including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered
 * inaccurate or a failure of the Software to operate with any other
 * programs, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such
 * damages.
 *
 * X. In addition to what this Licence otherwise provides, the Software
 * may be distributed in such a way as to be compliant with the GNU
 * Lesser General Public Licence, as published by the Free Software Foundation,
 * Cambridge, MA, USA; version 2.1, or, at your option, any later version;
 * incorporated herein by reference.  You must include a copy of this
 * Licence with such distribution.  Furthermore, patches sent to the
 * authors for the purpose of inclusion in the official release version
 * are considered cleared for release under the full terms of this
 * Licence.
 *
 * XI. The authors of NASM are the original authors (Simon Tatham and
 * Julian Hall) and all those who the original authors feel have
 * contributed significantly to the overall project.  If you wish to
 * contact the authors, Julian Hall (jules@earthcorp.com) should be your
 * first port of call.
 *
 * XII. Should any part of this agreement be deemed unenforcable, it is
 * intended that the remainder of the agreement be held in force.
 *
 * END OF LICENCE AGREEMENT

 * 
 * If you do make use of re2c, or incorporate it into a larger project an
 * acknowledgement somewhere (documentation, research report, etc.) would
 * be appreciated.
 * 
 * Please send bug reports and feedback (including suggestions for
 * improving the distribution) to

 * POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Summary
=======

Most of the code is either public domain, or under a 2- or 3-clause BSD
license (without the advertisement clause). However, due to the NASM license
(which allows the redistribution under the LGPL in clause X) and the
bitvect.c license (Artistic / GPL / LGPL), the resulting Yasm binaries are
covered by the LGPL.
